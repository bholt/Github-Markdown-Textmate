# Demo
Writing markdown has never been easier!

- Now you don't need to worry about keeping a preview pane open to see what it'll look like when you upload it to Github.
- It's like WYSIWYG, but without any magic: the markup is *still there!*
- Different fonts: headers in serifs, normal text sans-serif, but `fixed-width` for inline code
    - Hanging indents look great

> Quoted text stands out clearly.

## Commands
Comes with many useful commands:

1. Automatically create new list items, numbered and un-numbered, or continue comment blocks
2. Break out of lists or indent lists, all with intuitive key bindings

## Code blocks
Writing tutorials is a breeze when the code you write is syntax highlighted correctly. TextMate's embedded language grammars even allow you to use language-specific tools from within these code blocks.

~~~ ruby
def hello
  puts "Hello world!"
end
~~~

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  std::cerr << "Hello world.";
  return 0;
}
```

Or just plain code blocks:

    $ cd ~/Downloads/
    $ open Github\ Markdown.tmbundle
